/**
 * @brief This API implements an interface for using transciever channels to exchange data packets
 *          with other ezbus nodes. Such a channel is termed a `socket`.
 *          One `socket` replresents a signular tranceiver channel between this node, and a
 *          single peer. A `socket` must be 'opened' before it can be used. See @ref ezbus_socket_open()
 *          for more details. 
 *          In the case that an unsolicited parcel packet arrives from a peer (socket==EXBUS_SICKET_ANY), 
 *          a local `socket` will automatically be opened prior to @ref ezbus_socket_callback_recv() 
 *          being invoked. The socket remain opened until closed by the consumer of this API.
 *          Be sure to review @ref ezbus_socket_init(), @ref ezbus_socket_callback_send() and 
 *          @ref ezbus_socket_callback_recv()
