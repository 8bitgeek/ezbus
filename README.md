* EzBus is still under development.
* EzBus is a simple token-bus protocol for the RS-485 bus written in C. 
* EzBus is intended to be lightweight and simple enough for small memory footprint embedded systems.
* EzBus uses stream socket semantics for data transport.
* EzBus currently works with CARIBOU RTOS, and Linux, can be easily ported to other targets.
